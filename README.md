# 🔬 Hydromatic Simulator

Hydromatic Simulator provides a portable virtual space to configure and test the dynamic shape deformation of Soft Hydromatic Actuators (SHA) based on their binary-encoded structural designs. 

The program contains an implementable nodal position generator models presented in the paper "AI-Driven digitization of dynamic hand motion into soft matter." 

Based on the numerical simulation data from 10400 binary-encoded designs of SHAs, the 16 generator models simultaneously predict the dynamic nodal trajectories on XY-plane over the 24 h deformation period until equilibrium. The trajectory data were assembled to draw the 16-coordinate shape deformation results. The input SHA structural design can be manually configured through GUI editor. 

More detailed description of the code's functionality can be found from the Method Section of the manuscript.
